## Problem #1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiple of 3 and 5 simultaneously we get 3,5,6 and 9. The value of their sum is 23. Implement a method called Multiplo3_5(max), that returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 simultaneously that are above a given max number.

### How to run the python script
$ python3 Multiplo3_5.py max

## Problem #2

Using any programming language, implement a method called MudaLetras(str) that gets as parameter a string with this algorithm:

1. Change all the letters in the string str with the next letter of alfabet (for instance "c" transforms into "d" but "z" transforms into "a").).

2. Change all the vowels in the new string ("a,"e","i","o","u") for uppercase and lastly returns the new modified string.

### How to run the python script
$ python3 MudaLetras.py str
